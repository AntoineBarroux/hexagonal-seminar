# Hexagonal-Seminar

This project was developed in order to showcase how hexagonal architecture can helps developers to deeply test their code.
The main objective of this app is to provide seminar destination suggestions based on a few constraints :
- the departure airport
- the max CO2 consumption allowed
- the number of passengers

It is also possible to create a seminar based on these suggestions, then other suggestions will not be part of a country you already visited during the last 5 years.

The suggestion always maximizes the CO2 consumption. Of course, it is only a showcase project and does not represent our ecological values,
as we do not recommand to take planes.
